# jxfuPlot
It's a small python package to help you drawing a barplot with error bar and significance (*).

# Introduction
We can not find a python package that help you to draw a bar plot with error bar and significance, but these two elements are important in our statistic analysis when dealing with a big data in biological or economic project. To draw a plot with error bar and * conveniently, I designed a package based on seaborn, matplotlib, scipy and others.
